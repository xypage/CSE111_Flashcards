1	Who discovered penicillin?		
2	Alexander Fleming	Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming	./afleming_headshot.png
3	How many children can a node in a binary tree have?		
4	2 A node can also have 0 or 1, but 2 is the max		
5	What year did world war 2 start in? 	Where we consider the start to be the invasion of Poland.	
6	1939 	It's normally considered to have started 9/1/1939, with France and the UK declaring war on the 3rd.	
7	When did world war 2 end? 	If we consider Japan's surrender to be the end.	
8	September 2, 1945 	Japan announced it's intent to surrender on August 10th, and 23 days later they signed the surrender document.	
9	What is the search time in a Red-Black tree?		
10	O(log N) 	Insertion, deletion, rearrangement and recoloring also take O(log N) time.	
11	How many bits are used for the exponent in the IEEE 754 standard?	That being the (32 bit) single precision floating point format. 	
12	There are 8 exponent bits.	Note: the exponent is biased, so to get the actual exponent you subtract 127, making the max exponent 128 not 255.	
13	What is 0b1100 in decimal?		
14	12	1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 8 + 4 = 12	
15	What is the search time in a finger table used by Chord?		
16	O(log N)	As opposed to the naïve approaches O(N), a finger table here only takes O(log N).	./chord_network.png
17	What does CAP stand for in CAP theorem? 		
18	Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance		./cap_theorem.png
19	When was C created, and by who?		
20	C was first released in 1972, by Dennis Ritchie.	The most recent stable release was C17, in 2018.
